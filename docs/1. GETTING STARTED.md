Welcome to Synapse.

This document aims to get you started with contributing to this repo!


# 1. What do I need?

The code of Synapse is written in Python 3. To do pretty much anything, you'll need [a recent version of Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). For some tests, you will need [a recent version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Under Unix (macOS, Linux, BSD, ...)

Once you have installed Python 3, please open a Terminal and run:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/synapse
python3 -m venv ./env
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[all,lint,mypy,test,black,tox]"
```

## Under Windows

TBD

# 2. Get in touch

Join our developer community on Matrix: #synapse-dev:matrix.org !

# 3. Pick an issue

TBD

# 4. Run unit tests

The following command will run all unit tests:

```sh
python -m twisted.trial tests
```

If you wish to only run *some* unit tests, you may specify
another module instead of `tests`:

```sh
python -m twisted.trial tests.rest.admin.test_room
```

If your tests fail, you may wish to look at the logs:

```sh
less _trial_temp/test.log
```

# 5. Run integration tests

The following will run the test suite using postgres. You will need Docker.

```sh
./test_postgresql.sh
```

If you prefer running the same tests with SQlite instead, use this command. You will not need Docker.

```sh
tox -e py36
```

# 6. Run coding style tests

Before submitting a patch, please run the linters:

```sh
./scripts-dev/lint.sh
```

# 7. Open a Pull Request

TBD
